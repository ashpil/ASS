# ASS - Actually Semantic Styles

ASS is a WIP markup language, designed to fill a similar role as HTML/CSS do today, but as one entity that concerns itself with both content and styling, while reducing boilerplate.

Head to [`/documents`](/documents) for more information.

## Demo

We have provided an example file with code and you simply need to run `cargo run test02.asml`
in order to see the output. You can then experiment by writing some basic code yourself in the same or another file.

Supported Inputs: left, right, top, bottom, color, width, height

## Install

[Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), and Cargo will handle everything else for you. Just do `cargo run` from the directory.

**Note that just in case Rust is difficult to install, we also included a binary(ass) which can be run: `./ass`**

## Running Tests

To run unit tests use `cargo test`.
